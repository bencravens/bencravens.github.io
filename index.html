    <h1> Welcome to my website </h1>
    <p> This is the personal website of Ben Cravens. My background is in physics and computational modelling. At the University of Otago, I completed my BSc Hons (First Class) in Physics in 2019. During my undergraduate degree, I worked as a research assistant for the physics department every summer, focusing on computational modelling topics, conducting research on climate models, bayesian inference algorithms, and PDE solvers. I recieved the beverly bursary award during my studies, awarded to the top students in physics. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant for a year.
	
	At the end of my research career, I had job opportunities where I could apply my computational modelling skills to a career in data science, but decided not to out of a concern for the ethical issues this profession faces in relation to consumer privacy.
	
	I am currently studying civil engineering at the University of Canterbury, where I am in the first professional year (Second Year). I am taking my computational modelling skills and applying them to a useful area. As such, I am looking for work opportunities for internships at the end of this year (2020) that I will be able to count towards the practical requirements of my engineering degree.
	
	In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science-fiction and fantasy), martial arts (mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">BJJ</a>), and playing the guitar.
