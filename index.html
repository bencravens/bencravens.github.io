    <h1> <ul> <center> Curriculum Vitae </center> </ul> </h1>
    
	<h2> <u> Objective </u> </h2>
    	<p> I am studying a PGDipSc in Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington, specializing in cybersecurity. I have a strong background in programming and mathematics from my previous work in physics academia (BSc Hons first class, multiple research internships). I would like to apply my skills to an internship or graduate position in cybersecurity, software engineering, or research. </p>
	
	<h2> <u> Education </u> </h2>
	<h3> <strong>Bachelor of Science with Honours (First Class) - 2019 - University of Otago </strong> </h3>
	<p> Major in Physics, minor in Math. I took a lot of computational modelling  and programming classes. </p>
	<h3> <strong> PGDipSc in Computer Science - 2021 - Victoria University Wellington</strong> </h3>
		
	<h2> <u> Technical Skills </u> </h2>
	<h3> Everyday Use: </h3>
	<p>Python, MATLAB, Linux</p>
	<h3> Competent:</h3>
	<p>C, PHP, Julia, Bash, R, Java, HTML, CSS, TensorFlow, Keras, LaTeX, Vim, Git </p>
	<h3> Areas of proficiency: </h3>
	Computational mathematics, climate models, science communication, programming
	
	<h2> <u> Experience </u> </h2>
	<h3> Research Assistant - Otago Physics Department - November 2019 - December 2020</h3>
	<p> Implementing and testing computational statistics algorithms </p>
	<p> Technology/Tools: Python, numerical linear algebra </p>
	<h3> Honours Student - Climate Physics Group - Otago Physics Department - 2019 </h3>
	<p> Investigated and communicated the effect of a implementing a more detailed drag representation in a global climate model (HADGEM3)</p> 
	<p> Technology/Tools: Python, fluid dynamics, data science </p>
	<h3> Research Assistant - Climate Physics Group - Otago Physics Department - 2018 </h3>
	<p> Developed my own data science tools to analyse a large set (Terabytes) of climate model data </p>
	<p> Technology/Tools: Python, data science, Linux, shell scripting </p>
	<h3> Research Assistant - Electronics Group - Otago Physics Department - 2017 </h3>
	<p> Wrote software to harvest and process large amounts of satellite data to be used in a ML classifier systems to quantify land use in NZ.</p>
	<p> Technology/Tools: Python, GIS, Google API </p>
	
	<h2> <u> Technical Projects </u> </h2>
	<h3> Accelerated Gibbs Sampler </h3>
	<p> A python package which implements a series of gibbs sampler variants, including the chebyshev accelerated gibbs sampler, which converges faster than standard gibbs sampling algorithms.</p>
	<p> Technology/Tools: Python, MATLAB</p>

	<h3> Fast Spellchecker </h3>
	<p> Implemented a command-line spellchecker in C89. It uses a abstract "tree" data structure to compare words in a document with a given dictionary file of defined words. For this project I worked in a pair, giving me valuble communication and project managment experience. We got an A+ on this project.</p>
	<p> Technology/Tools: C89, valgrind, GDB </p>
