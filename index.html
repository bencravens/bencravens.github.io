    <h1> Welcome to my website </h1>
    <p> This is the personal website of Ben Cravens. My background is in physics and computational modelling. At the University of Otago, I completed my BSc Hons (First Class) in Physics in 2019. 
    During my undergraduate degree, I worked as a research assistant for the physics department every summer, focusing on computational modelling topics, conducting research on climate models, bayesian inference algorithms, and PDE solvers. 
    I recieved the Beverly Bursary prize during my studies, award to the top students in physics. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant for a year.</p>
    <p>At the end of my research career, I had job opportunities where I could apply my computational modelling skills to a career in data science, but decided not to out of a concern for the ethical issues this profession faces in relation to consumer privacy. </p>
    <p>I am currently studying civil engineering at the University of Canterbury, where I am in the first professional year (Second Year). I am looking for work opportunities for internships at the end of this year (2020) that I will be able to count towards the practical requirements of my engineering degree. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science-fiction and fantasy), martial arts (mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">BJJ</a>), and playing the guitar. </p>
