    <h1> Welcome to my website </h1>
    <p> This is the personal website of Ben Cravens. My background is in physics and computational modelling. At the University of Otago, I completed my BSc Hons (First Class) in Physics in 2019. 
    During my undergraduate degree, I worked as a research assistant for the physics department every summer, focusing on computational modelling topics. I conducted research on topics such as climate models and bayesian inference algorithms.</p>
    <p>At the end of my research career, I had job opportunities where I could apply my computational modelling skills to a career in data science, but decided not to out of a concern for the ethical issues this profession faces.</p>
    <p>Instead I am currently retraining in Engineering. I am interested in renewable energy, and hope to make a future career in energy R&D or policy.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science-fiction and fantasy), martial arts (mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">BJJ</a>), and playing the guitar. </p>
